# Kapital You Shareholders Agreement

This Kapital You Shareholders' Agreement (KYSA) is an agreement that has been made between the company, it's shareholders, it's directors, and every party that is directly involved in running the company's business or in providing financial or human capital to the company.

All of the signatories to this KYSA want to conduct the company's business in a way that does not directly subordinate any person, and that minimises the amount of indirect subordination in other businesses that will result from the conduct of the company's business, and which ensures that all contributions of human time and effort directly to the company are treated as contributions of human capital rather than as the provision of labor or services, and that such contributions will be rewarded with a portion of company income and control in the same way that other types of capital are.

The signatories to this KYSA have therefore agreed to conduct the business according to the following rules:

1. The company and of its subsidiaries will have no employees, and all business of the company will only be conducted by the company's shareholders and directors, or by signatories to this agreement who provide goods or services to or on behalf of the company under the terms of a separate contribution contract that they have made with the company, or by individuals and businesses that are not associated with or controlled in any way by the company or signatories to this agreement and that also offer goods and services to the general market and that have a genuine arms length relationship with the company.

2. A business, company, or incorporated body cannot become a signatory to this agreement if it directly or indirectly has employees or subordinates, or if it directly or indirectly controls another entity that has employees or subordinates, or if it is directly or indirectly controlled by another business or company or incorporated body that directly or indirectly has employees or subordinates. This rule will apply regardless of whether control is exerted by ownership, by contract, by economic or social influence, or by any other means. Any signatory that is a business, company, or incorporated body that acquires direct or indirect employees or subordinates or that acquires control over another business that has employees or subordinates or that becomes itself controlled either directly or indirectly by a business or company or incorporated body that directly or indirectly has employees or subordinates, will immediately cease to be a signatory and all that signatory's contribution contracts will be cancelled without compensation and all of that signatory's shares in the company will be forfeited and cancelled, and that signatory will cease to be a director if they are a director. If such a cancellation and forfeiture occurs, each remaining director individually has both the obligation and right to perform this cancellation and forfeiture on their own, and every other individual signatory has standing, on their own, in any court of law that has jurisdiction over the matter, to compel the remaining directors collectively or singly to make that cancellation and forfeiture. This KYSA will survive any such cancellation and will continue as an agreement between the remaining signatories only.

3. The directors and shareholders will ensure that the company DOES NOT take any action (including issuing shares or entering into a contribution contract) that has not been authorised by a vote of all the signatories to this KYSA, according to the rules set out in this KYSA. The directors and shareholders will also ensure that the company DOES carry out all actions that are approved by a vote of signatories according to these rules. The amount of votes that each signatory has is expressed as "Kapital Points", or KP. Each shareholder has one KP per share held, and each signatory that has a contribution contract with the company (and who may or may not be a shareholder) has an additional amount of KP that are defined in that contract during the duration of that contract. A vote must be unanimous with no signatory abstaining in order to authorise the company to take an action, unless a previous unanimous vote has been made which declared that particular kind of action could be authorised by a majority vote or by a vote by a certain quorum of signatories or by some other form of vote. A vote may delegate the decision for the company to take certain types of action to a subset of signatories according to particular rules defined in that vote, however if this is done then that delegation may be revoked unilaterally at any time by any individual signatory who initially voted for that delegation. The methods and processes used to propose a company action and to vote on it must be unanimously approved by all signatories to this agreement and must be equally accessible to all signatories at the same time and must not preferentially favour or empower any signatory over any other signatory. Furthermore, no individual signatory that holds a majority of all KP may approve a company action single handedly without the agreement of at least one other signatory that also holds at least one KP.

4. If signatories who control a minority of KP are blocking a vote for a company action that is supported by a majority of KP, then the company may, if approved by a majority of all KP, immediately cancel the contribution contracts of those signatories who oppose the vote, upon provision of any compensation required by those contribution contracts, and also compulsorily buy back all of the their shares for cash at face value, in order to break the deadlock. If this is done then the company must cancel all contribution contracts of all the signatories who are opposing the vote, and buy back all of their shares in entirety, and any of those signatories must have an opportunity to reverse their vote and avoid the cancellation and buyback within a reasonable time after the majority vote for the cancellation and buyback has passed. Unlike all other kinds of votes, a vote to perform a cancellation and buy back may be proposed and approved single handedly by a signatory that holds a majority of KP. If the company does not have sufficient funds to pay the those signatories for shares and compensation, then the cancellation and buy back must not proceed and those signatories will retain their contribution contracts and shares, however in this case any single signatory or group of signatories that is in favor of the vote may unilaterally authorize the company to enter into a contract with themselves to proceed with the cancellation and buy back in consideration for their providing sufficient funds to the company for it to be able to perform the cancellation and buy back.

5. The cancellation and compulsory buy out provisions of rule 4 of this KYSA will not apply to the contribution contracts and shares of any signatory who is identified as a founder of the company in the schedules attached to this KYSA, or who has been acknowledged as a founder by a unanimous vote. This will in effect provide any signatories who are founders with an unbreakable veto over any action of the company, as long as their contribution contracts and shares are not cancelled for violation of this agreement under rules 2 or 11. A signatory that is a company or other incorporated body and that is a founder will cease to be a founder if there is any change whatsoever to the direct or indirect ownership or control of that company or incorporated body, unless that change is approved by a unanimous vote of all signatories. Such a change of direct or indirect ownership or control may include but is not limited to: a change of directors; a change of contract obligations that affect control; a change of beneficial ownership; a change of ultimate holding company; a change of ownership or control of any company or trust of which the signatory is a direct or indirect subsidiary; or the issuance, cancellation, sale or transfer of shares in the signatory or in a company that is a direct or indirect holding company of the subsidiary in such a way that the relative control over the signatory by various parties holding those shares is altered.

6. The only payment, distribution, or transfer of money from the company to a signatory of this KYSA will be as either a dividend paid to a shareholder, or a payment made under a contribution contract between the company and that signatory that is paid at the same time a dividend is paid and that is equal to the per-share amount of that dividend multiplied by the number of KP that signatory has under their contribution contract. The company will make such a payment to all signatories who have contribution contracts whenever a dividend is paid, and the company will not pay any dividend unless it has enough equity and funds to pay both the dividend and the contribution contract payments.

7. The only provision of goods, services, or other non-monetary benefits from the company to a signatory will be those that are provided on a similarly proportional per-KP basis to all signatories at the same time, and the only provision of goods, services, and other non-monetary benefits from a signatory to the company will be in consideration for the receipt of shares or for a contribution contract that provides that signatory with KP for the duration of that contract.

8. There will be no loans between the signatories and the company, and any funds provided by a signatory to the company must be in consideration for the receipt of shares or for a contribution contract that provides that signatory with KP for the duration of the contract.

9. The signatories may approve specific one-time exceptions to rules 6, 7, and 8 above on a case by case basis by unanimous vote.

10. Subject to any applicable privacy law, and excluding people's personal login passwords as well as any specific exceptions approved by a majority vote, every signatory has the same right to access any information and communications about the company that an Owner, CEO, internal auditor, or information security officer traditionally has in non-KYSA businesses, because signatories collectively and individually are intended to fulfil all of those roles from time to time. All information about the company or that is held by the company (and that is not subject to privacy law), as well as all written communication about company business and minutes, recordings, or other records of all voice, video, or in-person communications, must be maintained in a form that is convenient for all subscribers to access, and the method provided for accessing all of this information must be equally accessible to all signatories at the same time and must not preferentially favour or empower any signatory over any other signatory. Each signatory consents to provide all the other signatories with access to copies of any documents, emails, instant message and chat logs, minutes, recordings, or other information that relates to their dealings with the company and their conduct of the company's business, in a way that is both timely and convenient for the other signatories to access, and agrees to only use communication tools and methods for company business that have been approved by a vote of all signatories.

11. Any signatory that causes the company to take, or that wilfully or with gross negligence fails to prevent the company from taking, an action that has not been approved by a vote according to the rules of this KYSA, or that holds out to a third party that they have authority to do so, or that wilfully or with gross negligence fails or refuses to record significant information or communication about the business in the manner that was agreed between the signatories, or that seeks to inhibit or that wilfully or with gross negligence fails to enable any other signatory's access to that information, will immediately cease to be a signatory and all that signatory's contribution contracts will be cancelled without compensation and all of that signatory's shares in the company will be forfeited and cancelled, and that signatory will cease to be a director if they are a director. If such a cancellation and forfeiture occurs, each remaining director individually has both the obligation and right to perform this cancellation and forfeiture on their own, and every other individual signatory has standing, on their own, in any court of law that has jurisdiction over the matter, to compel the remaining directors collectively or singly to make that cancellation and forfeiture. This KYSA will survive any such cancellation and will continue as an agreement between the remaining signatories only.
